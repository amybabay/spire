## Spire for the Substation Overview

Spire for the Substation is built to support real-time byzantine resilience
required for power grid substations. The system is designed to withstand both
system-level protective relay intrusions and network attacks on substation LAN,
while meeting the stringent quarter of a power-cycle latency requirement
(4.167ms).

The Spire for the Substation includes a Trip Master, Relay Proxy and Breaker
Proxy designed and developed from scratch. Additionally, we provide emulated
merging units and emulated relays to simulate real substation fault-free and
faulty situations. We support substation communication protocol of IEC61850
using open-source libiec61850.  The Trip Masters support real-time Byzantine
resilience protocols needed to tolerate faulty protective relays and provide
correct protection functions.  Communication between Spire for the Substation
components is protected using the [Spines intrusion-tolerant
network](http://www.spines.org).The Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion
Detection System that is built to work with Spire can be adopted by retraining
for Spire for the Substation.

The Trip Masters implement two protocols (Arbiter and Peer Protocols) with the
same architecture. Specifically, the architecture can tolerate f Byzantine
protective relays with k protective relays undergoing simultaneously with
2f+k+1 protective relays and their Spire for the Substation harness. The
protective relay publish GOOSE messages to their directly connected relay
proxy. The relay proxy sends IPC message about the event to Trip Master on same
machine. We refer to a relay and its attached Spire harness as relay node. The
Trip Master uses the Byzantine protocols to issue trip or close action commands
to the Breaker Proxy through intrusion-tolerant Spines network. The Breaker
Proxy, directly connected to Breaker IED, can in turn verify and issue GOOSE
commands to control the Breaker. We refer to the Breaker IED and its directly
connected Spire harness as Breaker node.

The system can be operated by connecting to physical hardware relays or with
the emulated relays provided.

Additionally, with Spire 3.0 release we can spin up multiple subsations running
individaual Spire for the Substation systems simultaneously. 

---

## Deployment Overview

A Spire for the Substation deployment includes: Trip Masters, Relay Proxies,
Breaker Proxy, Spines daemons and real or emulated relays (emulated merging
unit in case of emulated relays). These components are typically in a LAN
substation setting, connected by process bus in a typical IEC61850
architecture. The minimal system would involve 4 protective relays and a
Breaker node. The Trip Masters (Peer Protocol and Arbiter Protocol) come with
their respective Breaker Modules (simple_cb_proxy and counting_cb_proxy) as the
protocols vary.

A good (up and correct) protective relay will issue a trip when the grid needs
it. The Byzantine protocols (implemented in Trip Masters) ensure that a
protective relay under the control of an attacker cannot unilaterally change
the breaker state. While the system configuration remains same, the two
protocols involve running different components described later.

---

## Configuration

The example configuration (in the `spire/example_conf/ss_conf_4 folder`)
includes all configuration files needed for four relay nodes and one Breaker
node to tolerate one Byzantine protective relay and one protective relay
undergoing proactive recovery simultaneously.

There are several configuration files relevant to the Spire for the Substation system:

1. Main Spire configuration: `common/def.h`
    - The parameters needed for Spire for the Substation start from section
      titled "Substation System wide defines". 
    - Most of the parameters typically remain unchanged
    
2. Substation Configuration file: common/ss<id>.conf
    - We can instantiate multiple substaions each with their configuration file
      Each file consists of IPs of four relay nodes, one breaker node and one subsation HMI node
      Example files included in Spire are : common/ss17.conf, common/ss18.conf and common/ss19.conf 
    - Note that the ids 1-16 are used for other PLC/RTUs in pnnl, ems and heco scenarios. So, we typically use ids from 17.
    - If Spire for the Substation is run along with Spire in integrated scenario (cc_hmi) ensure that spires config/config.json file has appropriate information.
      The default config.json file includes 3 substaions (17 to 19) and these can be expanded as needed.

3. Spines configuration (`spines/daemon/spines.conf`) -- see Spines
   documentation for details. 
    - Note that internal and external Spines networks use different
      configuration files. 
    - Please ensure that Host IPs are the same as in the `common/def.h` file
    - The example conf files are in `spire/example_conf/ss_conf_4/` as
      `ss_spines_ext.conf` and `ss_spines_int.conf`
    - Typical IPs should of four relay nodes, breaker node, HMI node and cc_connector node.

4. Emulated Merging Unit, Emulated Relay, Relay Proxy and Breaker Proxy configuration:
    - Currently all important parameters are configurable from command line.
      (Usage and Running section below explains the details)

## Installation Prerequisites

### General Prerequisites

- OpenSSL development package
    * e.g. `yum install openssl-devel`, `apt-get install libssl-dev`

### Spines Prerequisites

- Lex and Yacc
    * e.g. `yum install flex byacc`, `apt-get install flex byacc`

### HMI Prerequisites

- QT development package and webkit
    * e.g. `yum install qt5-devel  qt5-qtwebkit-devel`, `apt-get install qt5-sdk`

- [pvbrowser](https://pvbrowser.de/pvbrowser/)
    * pvbrowser is packaged with Spire, located in the `pvb` directory.
    Building Spire (below) will build the pvbrowser.


    * Note that by default Spire looks for pvbrowser files in the `pvb` directory
      packaged with it. If you prefer to use a version of pvbrowser already
      installed on your system, you can modify the `PVB` variable in the
      Makefiles in the hmi directories to point to your installation (e.g.
      `/opt/pvb`)

---

## Building Spire for the Substation

1. Build libraries, Spines and Prime (from top-level Spire directory):

    make libs

2. Build Spire for the Substation (from top-level Spire directory):

    make substation

3. Note that we can clean with:

    make clean_substation

---

## Generating Keys

All system entities use RSA keys to authenticate messages, so keys must be
generated and distributed before the system can run.

1. Spines
    - To generate keys:

            cd spines/daemon; ./gen_keys

    - This creates 10 public-private key pairs in `spines/daemon/keys` (if you
      have more than 10 Spines daemons, you can modify the for loop in the
      script to create more keys)

    - Each Spines daemon should have access to its own private key (i.e. the
      Spines daemon listed as host 1 in the spines.conf file should have the
      key private1.pem) and the public keys of all the Spines daemons.

    - The key size can be set in spines/daemon/gen_keys.sh

2. Trip Master Keys
    - To generate keys for Peer Protocol:
        
        cd trip_master;./gen_keys

    - This generates the needed threshold signature scheme keys in
      trip_master/tm_keys) for Peer Protocol.
    - Each trip master should have access to its own threshold crypto share and
      public key.
    - The Breaker Proxy should have access to the threshold scheme's public key

3. Trip Master_v2 Keys
    - To generate keys for Arbiter Protocol

        cd trip_master_v2;./gen_keys

    - This generates private-public key pairs for all relay nodes
      (`private_01.key` and `public_01.key`, `private_02.key` and
      `public_02.key`, ...) and the Breaker node (`private_client_01.key` and
      `public_client_01.key`). The keys will be located in trip_master/tm_keys.
    - Each relay node should have access to its own key pair and the Breaker
      node's public key
    - The Breaker node has access to its own key pair and all relay nodes
      public keys

---

## Running Peer Protocol

Note that command line parameters in `ALL_CAPS` should match the corresponding
parameters in `common/def.h`

All instructions are from top-level directory.

1. Run all Spines daemons
    Each relay node needs to run both internal and external Spines networks. 
    The Breaker node needs to run an external Spines network daemon.

    To run (internal Spines network):

        cd spines/daemon; ./spines -p SS_SPINES_INT_PORT -c ss_spines_int.conf -I IP_ADDRESS

   To run (external Spines network):

        cd spines/daemon; ./spines -p SS_SPINES_EXT_PORT -c ss_spines_ext.conf -I IP_ADDRESS

   Note: These commands assume that the internal and external spines
   configuration files are located at `spines/daemon/ss_spines_int.conf` and
   `spines/daemon/ss_spines_ext.conf`, respectively

2. Run all Trip Masters
    cd trip_master; ./trip_master id substation_id 

    - The `id` should be the id of this relay node, starting from 1. For example,
      with four relay nodes they are 1-4.
    - The `substation_id` is the id of substation, starting from 17. For example,
       with 1st relay in subsattion 17 the command is ./trip_master 1 17

3. Run emulated relays

    cd relay_emulator; sudo ./goose_publisher interface id substation_id

    - The interface is the network interface to publish on. With emulated
      relays we recommend using `lo` (loopback)
    - `id` same as that of its trip master
    - `substation_id` same as that of its trip master

4. Run relay proxy

    cd proxy_iec61850;sudo ./relay_proxy relay_CB_Ref breaker_CB_Ref sub_interface pub_interface goID dataset trip_loaction_in_relay_goose

    - `relay_CB_Ref`: Relay control block reference that relay proxies
      subscribe to. For example: `simpleIOGenericIO/LLN0$GO$gcbAnalogValues`
    - `breaker_CB_Ref`: control block reference that relay proxies should
      publish with (for their respective relay) to inform about Circuit breaker
      state. For example, `SPMaster/LLN0$GO$GoCB01`. 
    - `sub_interface`: Interface to receive relay GOOSE on. For emulated relays
      it can be `lo`
    - `pub_interface`: Interface to publish Breaker status on. For emulated
      relays it can be `lo`
    - `goID`: for publishing Breaker state. For example, `SPMaster`.
    - `dataset`: For publishing Breaker state. For example,
      `SPMaster/LLN0\$dataset1`
    - `trip_location_in_relay_goose`: Location of goose trip or close payload
      in relay GOOSE of subscriber. For emulated relays the value is `1`
    - For example:
 sudo ./relay_proxy simpleIOGenericIO/LLN0$GO$gcbAnalogValues SPNo1Master/LLN0$GO$GoCB01 lo lo SPNo1Master SPNo1Master/LLN0$dataset1 1 

5. Benchmarking the Spire for the Substation
    
    cd benchmarks_ss; ./benchmark substation_id count

    - The `substation_id` is same as trip master
    - The `count` is number of actions to run. We support 1-1000000 actions.

Note: Emulated relays receive input by multicast on 224.1.1.1 and port 8401.
These can be configured in common/def.h file. So, ensure that the testbed has
multicast enabled.

## Running Arbiter Protocol

Note that command line parameters in `ALL_CAPS` should match the corresponding
parameters in `common/def.h`

All instructions are from top-level spire directory.

1. Run all Spines daemons
    Each relay node needs to run only external Spines networks. 
    The Breaker node needs to run an external Spines network daemon.

   To run (external Spines network):

        cd spines/daemon; ./spines -p SS_SPINES_EXT_PORT -c ss_spines_ext.conf -I IP_ADDRESS

   Note: These commands assume that the internal and external spines
   configuration files are located at `spines/daemon/ss_spines_int.conf` and
   `spines/daemon/ss_spines_ext.conf`, respectively

2. Run all Trip Masters
    
    cd trip_master_v2; ./trip_master id substation_id


    - The `id` should be the id of this relay node, starting from 1. For example,
      with four relay nodes they are 1-4.
    - The `substation_id` is the id of substation, starting from 17. For example,
       with 1st relay in subsattion 17 the command is ./trip_master 1 17

3. Run emulated relays

     cd relay_emulator; sudo ./goose_publisher interface id substation_id

    - The interface is the network interface to publish on. With emulated
      relays we recommend using `lo` (loopback)
    - `id` same as that of its trip master
    - `substation_id` same as that of its trip master

 4. Run relay proxy

    cd proxy_iec61850;./relay_proxy relay_CB_Ref breaker_CB_Ref sub_interface pub_interface goID dataset trip_loaction_in_relay_goose

    - `relay_CB_Ref`: Relay control block reference that relay proxies
      subscribe to. For example: `simpleIOGenericIO/LLN0$GO$gcbAnalogValues`
    - `breaker_CB_Ref`: control block reference that relay proxies should
      publish with (for their respective relay) to inform about Circuit breaker
      state. For example, `SPMaster/LLN0$GO$GoCB01`. 
    - `sub_interface`: Interface to receive relay GOOSE on. For emulated relays
      it can be `lo`
    - `pub_interface`: Interface to publish Breaker status on. For emulated
      relays it can be `lo`
    - `goID`: for publishing Breaker state. For example, `SPMaster`.
    - `dataset`: For publishing Breaker state. For example,
      `SPMaster/LLN0\$dataset1`
    - `trip_location_in_relay_goose`: Location of goose trip or close payload
      in relay GOOSE of subscriber. For emulated relays the value is `1`
    - For example:
 sudo ./relay_proxy simpleIOGenericIO/LLN0$GO$gcbAnalogValues SPNo1Master/LLN0$GO$GoCB01 lo lo SPNo1Master SPNo1Master/LLN0$dataset1 1 

5. Benchmarking the Spire for the Substation

    cd benchmarks_ss; ./benchmark2 substation_id count

    - The `substation_id` is same as trip master
    - The `count` is number of actions to run. We support 1-1000000 actions.

Note: Emulated relays receive input by multicast on 224.1.1.1 and port 8401.
These can be configured in common/def.h file. So, ensure that the testbed has
multicast enabled.

Note on Logging: The print level in all main Modules is controlled by enabling
needed type in `Alarm_set_types`. The PRINT level is minimal logging followed
by STATUS and DEBUG levels.

Other optional Modules for both protocols:

Note: proxy and hmis folder compiles by compiling Spire with 'make' from top level directory.

1. Substation HMI and IED Connector: 

Note: These processes are optional, not needed for benchmarks but can be used to support operator commands from substation

  Run IED Connector on each relay node:
 
  cd proxy; sudo ./ied_connector ip id interface substation_id 
  
    - `ip` is the IP address of the node
    - `interface` to publish commands to real or emulated relay on.
      With emulated relays use lo (loopback)
    - `id` same as that of its trip master
    - `substation_id` same as that of its trip master

  On HMI node: 
    - Run external spines
    - Run one of the substation HMIs (ss1_hmi or ss2_hmi or ss3_hmi).
   
   cd hmis/ss1_hmi; ./ss_hmi ip subsattion_id -port=pvbrowser_port
    
    - `ip` is the IP address of the node
    - `substation_id` same as that of its trip master
    - `pvbrowser_port` is the port on which the HMI will accept pvbrowser connections
   to interface with the GUI that reflects the current power grid state and
   allows a human operator to enter commands.

   To connect GUI: Run `pvbrowser` application (located in main `pvb`
   installation folder). In the browser's address bar, give the IP address of
   the HMI and the `pv_port` (e.g. 192.168.101.108:5050).
    
2. CC Connectors:
  
 It is optional, needed only when we want to run the end-to-end system (Spire at control center with integrated scenario (cc_hmi).

Note that the number of cc connectors and their IPs are define in common/def.h (NUM_CC_CONNECTORS, and CC_CONNECTORS).

On these nodes run each connector node, run a connector for each susbation.

	cd proxy; ./cc_connector substation_id id
    
	- The `subsation_id` is is same as trip_master
	- The `id` start from 1 and go on until NUM_CC_CONNECTORS
	  This is to enable multple cc connectors for each substation 



### (Optional) Setup Intrusion Detection System

The Intrusion Detection was built as a standalone component. See inside the `ids` folder for details
on setup and running.

### Example to run Spire for the Substation with Peer Protocol

The default configuration files can support both protocols. The configuration
file of each substation (common/ss<id>.conf) defines a system with four relay nodes, one Breaker
node, and one  HMI node. Additionally, with integrated scenario the `CC_CONNECTORS`,
`SPINES_HMI_ADDR` and `SPINES_RTU_ADDR` parameters of common/def.h file will also
be relavant.

* Note that you will need to adjust IP addresses in the configuration files common/ss<id>.conf and
  commands to match testbed environment.

For benchmarks, each relay node consists of Spines daemon(s), Relay
Proxy and Trip Master. The Breaker node consists of Spines daemon and Breaker
Proxy. Additionally each relay node can have an emulated relay and each
substation has one emulated merging unit. 

In case of real Relays we can replace emulated relays and emulated merging unit with real relays. 

For Subsation HMI we would additionally need IED connector on each relay node and one substation HMI.

For integrated scenario, we would need to run cc connectors also.

For below instructions let  substation with substation_id 17 has the following IPs defined in it common/ss17.conf file:
    - Relay Node 1: 192.168.101.101
    - Relay Node 2: 192.168.101.102
    - Relay Node 3: 192.168.101.103
    - Relay Node 4: 192.168.101.104
    - Breaker Node: 192.168.101.105
    - HMI Node    : 192.168.101.106

The benchmark program  generates the relay input (emulated Sampled Values) that
trigger Trip or Close GOOSE. It also runs the Breaker Proxy logic. This enables
end-to-end latency measurements on same machine with same clock. The latency is
measured from Sampled Value issue to Circuit Breaker State change. It is to be
noted that emulated relays react to emulated Sampled Values, hence, their
processing delay is negligible. 

In case real physical relays are used with real Breaker IED, we provide
independent Breaker Proxies for either protocols in the proxy_iec61850 folder
as simple_cb_proxy for Peer Protocol and counting_cb_proxy for Arbiter
Protocol. 
Please note that when we use real relays, we should not run emulated relays.


The Breaker Proxy can be run with their respective Trip Master modules by commands:
On 192.168.101.105:

        cd spines/daemon; ./spines -p 10210 -c ss_spines_ext.conf
        cd proxy_iec61850;sudo ./simple_cb_proxy interface substation_id (For Peer protocol with trip_master)
                            or
        cd proxy_iec61850;sudo ./counting_cb_proxy interface substation_id (For Arbiter protocol with trip_master_v2)

Interface should be the interface used to connect to Circuit Breaker IED. For,
emulated relays we recommend using `lo` (loopback).

**Note on operating emulated relays (independently without benchmark program):**

The emulated relays are controlled through emulated Sampled Values. The
emulated Sample values can be generated through the `emulated_mu` program in
the `emulated_relay` folder. The commands are:

Invole a emulated merging unit for a substaion with command:
	./emulated_mu substation_id
Example: ./emulated_mu 17

The following commands from stdin of the program will generate Samples Value (SV) messages

`s 1` - Generate Simple Trip, i.e., all relays will issue Trip action GOOSE immediately.

`s 0` - Generate Simple Close, i.e., all relays will issue Close action GOOSE immediately.

`b relay1_delay relay1_event relay2_delay relay2_event  relay3_delay relay3_event relay4_delay relay4_event` - Relays generate their event(0/1 for close or trip) with the specified delays. This helps generate Byzantine behavior.

Instead of benchmarks program, please run breaker proxy with breaker IED.
